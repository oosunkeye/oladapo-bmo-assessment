## Question 1:

I spent almost 6hours writing the code because I have to write both front-end React and back-end SQL, and Node for the API.

## Question 2:

Calling the API and redisplaying the result to the user without leaving the home page.

## Question 3:

A. It is knowing when they exist and figures out why they are slow. By logging the performance of the application, what's running. How long it takes to complete a task.
B. Yes, I implemented production performance logging where I helped in identifying problems by logging what's running and I made also sure performance logging doesn't block the performance program itself.

## Question 4:

I wrote a basic API for the project and it's using a free server, which will cause the server request and response to be slow.

## Question 5:

I use JSON for serializing and transmitting structured data. I have also used JSON to pass data from PHP to Javascript.

## I CREATED A NEW API

I didn't populate the table with much data. I uploded the node server and SQL script
